#' cqrIS: Censored Quantile Regression with Induced Smoothing
#'
#' This package is an implementation of the estimation and inference procedure of a quantile
#' regression model which is based on a stochastic differential equation, with a smoothed
#' version based on induced smoothing technique. The parameters are obtained either by minimizing
#' an equivalent objective $l_1$ function of an estimating equation, or by solving an induced-smoothed
#' version of it. Two generalizations to handle functional data and recurrent event data respectively
#' are also implemented. For inference procedure, the multiplier bootstrap approach is used.
