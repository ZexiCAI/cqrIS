Description: This package is an implementation of the estimation and inference procedure of a censored quantile regression model to fit ordinary survival data, with interquantile smoothness improvements. It also provides tools to fit a censored quantile regression model to functional covariates and a recurrent event model to doubly-censored recurrent events.
